# 🩺 Skin Cancer Classification using HAM10000  
### CNN & ResNet50 Implementation + Streamlit Deployment

This project focuses on automatic skin cancer classification using the HAM10000 dermatoscopic image dataset.  
Two deep-learning models—**Custom CNN** and **ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)**—were trained and evaluated for classifying **7 skin lesion types**.
